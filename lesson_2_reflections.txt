>>What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

That folder becomes the repository and a .git folder
is created which keeps all the data git requires e.g.
versions of the file.

>>How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to check your work before 
committing to it. Its a go between for the two.
